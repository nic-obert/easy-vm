# Assembler

### TODO

- [ ] eventually, upgrade the assembler to use a parsing tree to allow for more complex expressions (const expressions, for example)  
- [ ] add optional debug information in compiled binaries with -d assembler flag (and -d flag also in the vm to execute debug builds)  
- [ ] add compiletime arithmetics in the data section (maybe allow const arithmetic inside {})  

### In Progress


### Done âœ“

- [x] update eventual libraries and code to remove the stp register

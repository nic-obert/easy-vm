# Project

### TODO

- [ ] build a byte code inspector and disassembler (maybe extension for vscode or standalone program). It must be flexible because a strict disassembler wouldn't be able to handle static data declarations inside the binary (how is it supposed to know it's static data instead of an instruction?. I've tried with debug-specific marker instructions, but they would alter the behavior of debug assemblies wth respect to release builds)  

### In Progress


### Done âœ“

- [x] Create a rust tool to automatically generate an asm library file with info about the vm architecture  
- [x] write a README.md for every module  
- [x] change project name to something better

# Project

### TODO

- [ ] make r1 and r2 specific operation registers and add new r1 and r2 registers. The reason is that the programmer may use r1 and r2 registers and be unaware of them being invalidated by other parts of the code  
- [ ] build a byte code inspector (maybe extension for vscode or standalone program)  
- [ ] update the disassembler (when the vm and assembler become more stable)  

### In Progress


### Done âœ“

- [x] Create a rust tool to automatically generate an asm library file with info about the vm architecture  
- [x] write a README.md for every module  
- [x] change project name to something better

# Virtual Machine

### TODO

- [ ] test host_fs module (with copilot)  
- [ ] add colors to built-in terminal  
- [ ] add video module (separate process/thread that reads from video memory and writes to screen, don't worry about race conditions)  
- [ ] implement a default built-in allocator for unlimited memory  
- [ ] print byte operands when vm is in interactive mode (use expected operand size + handled size) (kind of a disassembly, wait till disassembler is done)

# Oxide

Project Description

<em>[TODO.md spec & Kanban Board](https://bit.ly/3fCwKfM)</em>

### Todo

- [ ] add a -o flag to enable optimizations. optimizations should be disabled by default  
- [ ] implement const functions  
- [ ] implement type inference for variable declaration. valid only if variable is immediately initialized.  
- [ ] implement module system  
- [ ] implement enums  
- [ ] implement structs  
- [ ] differentiate between string literals (stack) and heap-allocated strings  

### In Progress

- [ ] add tests and compile-time assertions  
- [ ] implement oprimizations  
- [ ] write a function like "reduce_operations()" to evaluate compile-time operations  

### Done âœ“

- [x] implement while and if  
- [x] add more source context in error messages (and highlight the main line)  
- [x] use dedicated ChildrenTypes for tokens that don't have strictly list children  
- [x] implement array indexing  
- [x] make scopes into expressions
